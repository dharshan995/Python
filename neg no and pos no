This program prompts the user to enter the number of numbers they want to input ('n'). Then, it enters a while loop that iterates 'n' times. Inside the loop, it prompts the user to enter each number. Depending on whether the number is positive, negative, or zero, it increments the respective counters. Finally, it prints out the counts of positive and negative numbers entered.
